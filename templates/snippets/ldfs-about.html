  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>
    At a recent digital library conference, a group made up of representatives 
    from a variety of different academic, public, and non-profit organizations like 
    <a href="http://dp.la">Digital Public Library of America</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.amherst.edu/">Amherst College</a>, 
    <a href="http://www.bpl.org/">Boston Public Library</a>, and 
    <a href=https://www.coloradocollege.edu">Colorado College</a> came together and organized 
    what eventually is a Python-based implementation of an open-source 
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/ldfs-mockup.png') }}" class="img-thumbnail">
    <a href=https://github.com/jermnelson/linked-data-fragments">Linked Data Fragments server</a>  
    using the new Python 3.4 asyncio module for building a fast, lightweight network server 
    that uses Redis, a NoSQL datastore technology, for caching results. 
    This presentation will present the preliminary results from testing the Linked Data 
    Fragments server with large datasets from college library catalogs as well as 
    datasets from the Library of Congress and the DPLA.

  <h3>Linked Data Fragments and SPARQL</h3>
  <h3>Problem</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Using RDF vocabularies for metadata creation and enhancement 
       often relies on availability and performance of external services</li>
    <li>These services, unfortunately, are not always reliable (e.g. SPARQL endpoints)</li>
    <li>Any implementation should be reusable across applications and ideally software 
    independent</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Linked Data Fragments</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Implement a mechanism that allows you to use
     selector patterns to specify subsection of triples 
     you care about, e.g. skos:prefLabel for LCSH</li>
    <li>Provide a configurable cache layer for remote resources 
    to speed up lookups on often-requested subjects</li>
    <li>Linked Data Fragments (<a href="http://linkeddatafragments.org/">
    http://linkeddatafragments.org/</a>)</li>
    <li>Simple standardized requests that are easily cacheable (less unique than SPARQL queries) with most query processing done client side</li>
  </ul>
